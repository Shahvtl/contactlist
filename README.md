# This is the React Contact List App to manage contacts using Redux

The user can Add, Edit, Update and Delete the contact here using the dummy API.

## Features

The user can add a contact by clicking on the Add Contact Button.

I have used this API - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to fetch and show the users.

The existing contact can be updated using the Edit button on the home page.

If the user want to Delete the contact permanently then delete button will do this function for the user.
